<hr/>
<h3>1. The only Way and the Hard Way</h3>
<p> The tachicality of the movie is one of the things that I admired bout the movie</p>
<h3>2. Matrix</h3>
<p>The story line is about two different kingdom-darkness and light. It is highly spiritual</p>
<h3>3. Seeker of the Legend</h3>
<p>I love the spirituality of the movie. Myline did not know who he is 
but the seeker understands that he is the saviour of mankind from the forces of evill.</p>
